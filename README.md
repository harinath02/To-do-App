## Features

- Add new tasks with an optional due date.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter tasks by completion status (all, completed, active) and by due date.
- Sort tasks by the date they were added or by due date.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage` to keep tasks across page reloads.
